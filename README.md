# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code challenges. It is not intended to be a guide or tutorial, but rather a personal record of my progress. Solutions are not very elegant, but with a goal to make every day's solution a little better way than the previous one. One day I might rewrite previous solutions to account for style.
